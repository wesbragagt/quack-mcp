## Installation

### Local Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- **Node.js 24+** (required)

```bash
npm install
```

**Why Node.js 24 is required:**
- **Native TypeScript support** - Run `.ts` files directly without compilation
- **Modern ES modules** - Full support for `import`/`export` syntax used throughout the codebase
- **Built-in test runner** - Uses Node.js native test runner (`node --test`)
- **Security updates** - Latest security patches and improvements

This eliminates the need for build tools like `tsc`, `ts-node`, or bundlers, making development faster and deployments simpler.

### Docker Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Access to CSV files on your host system

#### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t quack-mcp .

# Or use docker-compose for easier management
docker-compose up quack-mcp
```

#### Development Mode

```bash
# Run with hot reload for development
docker-compose up quack-mcp-dev
```

## Usage

### Local Usage

The server runs via stdin/stdout transport for MCP protocol:

```bash
node src/index.ts
```

### Docker Usage

```bash
# Run with docker-compose (recommended)
docker-compose up quack-mcp

# Or run directly with Docker
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data:ro \
  -v /path/to/your/csv/files:/app/csv-data:ro \
  quack-mcp
```

**Note**: Mount your CSV files as volumes so the container can access them.

## Using with Claude Code

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed and configured
- Either Node.js installed (for local) OR Docker installed (for containerized)

### Local Configuration

For local installation, add the following to your Claude Code MCP configuration file (usually `~/.config/claude-code/mcp_servers.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quack-csv": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/quack-mcp/src/index.ts"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}

## Glob Pattern Reference

Multi-CSV tools support glob patterns for flexible file matching:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `*` | Matches any characters | `sales_*.csv` matches `sales_q1.csv`, `sales_2024.csv` |
| `**` | Matches directories recursively | `data/**/*.csv` finds CSVs at any depth in `data/` |
| `?` | Matches single character | `report_?.csv` matches `report_1.csv`, `report_A.csv` |
| `[abc]` | Matches any character in brackets | `sales_[123].csv` matches `sales_1.csv`, `sales_2.csv`, `sales_3.csv` |
| `[a-z]` | Matches character range | `file_[a-c].csv` matches `file_a.csv`, `file_b.csv`, `file_c.csv` |

**Example Patterns:**
- `*.csv` - All CSV files in current directory
- `data/*.csv` - All CSV files in data directory
- `reports/**/*.csv` - All CSV files in reports directory and subdirectories
- `sales_2024_*.csv` - All sales files for 2024
- `**/monthly_[0-9][0-9].csv` - Monthly files with 2-digit numbers, anywhere in directory tree

**Note:** All patterns work with local files. DuckDB handles the glob expansion internally.

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Use Clear, Natural Language
Instead of technical commands, use natural descriptions:
- ❌ "Execute load_csv with file_path=/data/sales.csv"
- ✅ "Load the sales data from /data/sales.csv"

### 2. Leverage Claude's SQL Knowledge
Ask for complex analysis in plain English:
- "Show me the correlation between price and sales volume"
- "Find seasonal patterns in the data"
- "Identify outliers in the revenue column"

### 3. Iterative Analysis
Build on previous queries:
- "Now filter that result to only include 2024 data"
- "Add a column showing the percentage change from last month"

### 4. Data Visualization Requests
Ask for formatted output:
- "Create a summary table of sales by region"
- "Show the top 10 results formatted nicely"

### 5. Multi-CSV Best Practices
When working with multiple CSV files:
- **Use `union_by_name=true`** when files have different column orders or missing columns
- **Enable `filename=true`** to track which file each row came from
- **Use `discover_csv_files`** first to see what files match your pattern
- **Start with a small pattern** to test schema compatibility before loading all files
- **Use descriptive table names** when loading multiple datasets

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Load all sales files with union_by_name and filename tracking"
- ✅ "First discover what CSV files are in /data/reports/ then load them"
- ✅ "Load quarterly files and analyze by source file"

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Found
If Claude Code can't find the MCP server:

**Local Installation:**
1. Check that the path in your configuration is absolute and correct
2. Verify Node.js is installed and accessible
3. Restart Claude Code after configuration changes

**Docker Installation:**
1. Ensure Docker image is built: `docker build -t quack-mcp .`
2. Check Docker is running and accessible
3. Verify volume mount paths are correct and absolute
4. Restart Claude Code after configuration changes

### Permission Errors

**Local Installation:**
1. Ensure the CSV file path is correct and accessible
2. Check file permissions
3. Use absolute paths for CSV files

**Docker Installation:**
1. Ensure CSV files are mounted as volumes in Docker configuration
2. Check volume mount paths are correct: `-v /host/path:/app/csv-data:ro`
3. Verify Docker has permission to access the mounted directories
4. Use paths relative to container mount points (e.g., `/app/csv-data/file.csv`)

### Container Issues

**Docker-specific problems:**
1. **Container won't start**: Check Docker logs with `docker logs <container-id>`
2. **File not found**: Ensure CSV files are properly mounted as volumes
3. **Permission denied**: Check file permissions on host system
4. **Memory issues**: DuckDB requires sufficient container memory for large CSV files

### SQL Errors
If queries fail:
1. Check the table name (use `list_tables` to verify)
2. Verify column names with `describe_table`
3. Remember DuckDB uses standard SQL syntax

### Performance Issues
For large CSV files:

**Both Local and Docker:**
1. DuckDB is optimized for analytics but very large files may take time to load
2. Consider using `LIMIT` clauses for initial exploration
3. The server loads data into memory - ensure sufficient RAM

**Docker-specific:**
1. Increase container memory limits if needed
2. Consider mounting CSV files read-only for better performance

## MCP Client Configuration

### Local Installation
For other MCP clients, add to your configuration:

```json

  "mcpServers": {
    "quack-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/quack-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Installation
For containerized deployment with other MCP clients:

```json
